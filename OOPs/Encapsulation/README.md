Encapsulation is hiding the data and make it inaccessible by the object pointers. These data memebrs can be accessed only using functions.


Rules of Encapsulation:
- Data memebers should be labeled as private using private access specifier
- The member function which manipulates the data members should be labeled as public using the public access specifier
